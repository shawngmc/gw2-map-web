### Donate 
* First off, please support Arena.net for making the great APIs - buy things with gems and comment in the forums about the usefulness of their web APIs!
* If you want to help subsidize my server costs, development time, and unlimited harvesting tools, go to: paypal.me/shawngmc
* At least right now, my costs are pretty well managed, so you don't need to do this!
